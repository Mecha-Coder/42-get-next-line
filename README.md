### **About**

ðŸ‘‰ [**Project requirement**](https://github.com/Mecha-Coder/42-get-next-line/blob/main/demo/en.subject.pdf)

From the title is sounds simple. But is not!

```C++
read (int fd, void *buf, size_t size)
```

Above is the system call used for reading file. The 2nd argument `void *buf` is a memory buffer where the kernel copies the raw bytes it reads. If the buffer is small, multiple reads are needed to complete one line. If itâ€™s large, it might read multiple lines at once â€” meaning we must store the extra data somewhere and remembers it in the next function call. The challenge here is we donâ€™t know the line length, and still return one line per function call.

Here is an example of a text file:

```text
Hello world
Nice day
Good night
```

Lets clarify what a **line** is. A line is a sequence of characters ending with the newline character `\n`. This file contains 3 lines: "Hello world\n", "Nice day\n", and "Good night\n"


So the get_next_line() function must:
- Read raw data from the file descriptor using read()
- Accumulate characters until a newline \n is found
- Return that line, and
- Store the remaining text for the next call â€” without using global variables

This is where static variables come in. A static variable retains its value between function calls but remains private to the functionâ€™s scope. This allows us to remember leftover data between reads
